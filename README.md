## This integration is deprecated
Home Assistant 0.104 and newer includes official GIOŚ integration.
Differences between the official and custom version:
- no configurable `scan interval`
- data is represented in `air_quality` entity

These differences result from the requirements for official integrations. You can still use the custom version of the integration. If you want to use the official version, remove integration from Configuration -> Integrations, remove component's files from the `/config/custom_components` folder and restart Home Assistant.

The integration collects data about air quality in Poland from [GIOŚ](http://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/current) and present as sensors in Home Assitant. You can add this to Home Assistant via `Configuration -> Integrations -> button with + sign -> GIOŚ`. You can add this integration several times for different locations, e.g. home and work.
